# PsychENCODE-DSPN
#DSPN
Contains demo code for DSPN-full and DSPN-mod, SCZ, BPD and ASD models.

For formatted data files, see http://resource.psychencode.org/, files: INT-20_DSPNcode_SCZ.zip, INT-21_DSPNcode_BPD.zip, INT-22_DSPNcode_ASD.zip, INT-23_DSPN-mod_code_SCZ.zip, INT-24_DSPN-mod_code_BPD.zip, INT-25_DSPN-mod_code_ASD.zip.

The bare code is shown in the DSPN-full and DSPN-mod subfolders. The zip folders are set up with the specific parameter settings appropriate for each submodel, but no data.  To run a given submodel on the original data, use the formatted data files from the the PEC resource site (link above), which contain both the code with specific parameter settings as here and the input data.
